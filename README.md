Mario-Game

Overview of Mario-Game

This project is a browser-based 2D platformer game developed using the Kaboom.js game development 
library. It combines classic platforming elements with a few unique features, such as dynamic level 
progression and player state management. The game features multiple levels, each with its own layout 
and challenges, including enemies, collectible coins, and power-ups. The player's objective is to navigate 
through these levels, collecting coins and avoiding or defeating enemies to achieve the highest possible 
score.
The game initializes with the Kaboom.js configuration, setting up a full-screen canvas with specific 
scaling and debug options enabled. Key game constants like movement speed, jump force, and enemy 
speed are defined to control player and enemy behavior. The player is prompted to enter a username, 
which, along with their highest score, is stored locally using the browser's localStorage.
Several assets are loaded from an external source, including sprites for the player character, enemies, and 
various level elements. The game scene is constructed using a series of predefined maps, each 
represented as a string array where different characters correspond to specific game objects, such as 
blocks, coins, and enemies. These maps are used to generate the level layout dynamically.




Mario-Game Features

Here are some key features you might want to consider implementing to enhance the gameplay and overall 
experience:
1. Multiple Levels:  Currently, you have defined different maps for different levels. You 
can expand on this by adding more levels with increasing difficulty, new obstacles, 
enemies, and surprises.
2. Enemy Behavior:  Enhance enemy behavior to make them more challenging. You can 
introduce different types of enemies with unique movement patterns, abilities, and 
weaknesses. Additionally, consider implementing boss battles at the end of each level for 
an added challenge.
3. Collectibles and Rewards: Besides coins, introduce other collectibles such as gems, 
stars, or hidden treasures. Offer rewards for collecting these items, such as unlocking 
bonus levels, cosmetic upgrades for the player character, or access to secret areas.
4. Achievements and Challenges: Add achievement systems with various challenges 
and objectives for players to complete. Reward players with unique rewards or 
recognition for accomplishing these achievements


DEVOPS Features

The project follows DevOps practices, including Continuous Integration/Continuous
Deployment (CI/CD), to streamline development and operations processes. Key benefits and
features include:
1. Improved collaboration between development and operations teams.
2. Increased automation for build, testing, and deployment processes.
3. Faster delivery of new features and updates to users.
4. Higher quality software through continuous testing and monitoring.
5. Automated build and testing with every code change (Continuous Integration).
6. Automated deployment to staging or production environments after successful testing
(Continuous Deployment).
7. Infrastructure provisioning and management through code (Infrastructure as Code).
8. Consistent and portable deployments using containerization (e.g., Docker).
